# Website Upgrade TODO

- [ ] Test the site across modern browsers to confirm Tailwind v4 and React 19 behave as expected
- [ ] Review service worker caching strategy and update `CACHE_NAME` if assets change
- [ ] Confirm Google Analytics ID injection still works after build
- [ ] Consider migrating from `react-helmet` to `react-helmet-async` for better async support
- [ ] Update README with any new build or deployment instructions once migration is complete
