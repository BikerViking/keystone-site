# Keystone Notary Group

This is a small React site styled with Tailwind CSS.

The application includes basic Progressive Web App (PWA) support with an
offline-capable service worker and web app manifest.

## Analytics

Google Analytics 4 tracking is included with privacy-friendly defaults. Update
the measurement ID in `public/index.html` and adjust consent logic as needed.
Optional snippets for Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity are also provided in the head
section but are disabled by default.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later

## Getting Started

This project uses npm overrides to pin certain transitive dependencies to secure versions.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Project Structure

- `src/` - React components and pages
- `public/` - Static assets and HTML template

- `build/` - Production-ready assets generated by `npm run build`

## Updating the Service Worker

1. Modify `public/service-worker.js` as needed. Bump the `CACHE_NAME` constant to force clients to update.
2. Add any new assets or pages (like `offline.html`) to the pre-cache list.
3. Run `npm run build` to generate the production files.
4. Deploy the contents of the `build/` directory to your hosting provider.

## Testing Offline Support

1. Start the development server with `npm start`.
2. Open the site in a browser and verify the service worker registers without errors (check DevTools > Application > Service Workers).
3. With DevTools open, set the network mode to "Offline" and refresh the page to confirm the cached assets and offline page load correctly.
4. Run `npm test` to execute unit tests.
