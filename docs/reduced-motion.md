# Reduced Motion Setting

The service cards include a stacked-scroll animation. This effect is disabled when your operating system's **Reduce Motion** accessibility setting is turned on, as indicated by the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.

If you do not see the stack animation, check your OS accessibility options and temporarily disable "Reduce Motion". Reload the page to confirm that the animation appears.
